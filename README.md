_**Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model**_
This repository contains the solution to Task-05 from Comillas Negras, where the objective is to develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content.
This tool is designed to help users track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.


**Project Overview**
**Objective**
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can:
**Recognize Food Items: **Identify different types of food from images.
**Estimate Calorie Content:** Calculate the approximate calorie content of the identified food items.
This model aims to assist users in monitoring their daily food intake by providing accurate food recognition and calorie estimation directly from images.


**Key Features**
**Image Processing:** Preprocessing images to ensure optimal model performance.
**Food Classification:** Implementing a deep learning model to classify various food items.
**Calorie Estimation:** Using nutritional databases or regression models to estimate the calorie content based on recognized food items.



**Results**
The model achieves accurate recognition of various food items and provides reliable calorie estimates.
This allows users to gain insights into their dietary habits and make healthier food choices based on the calorie content.
